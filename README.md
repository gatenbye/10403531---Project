I chose to implement the simplified protocol. I didn't get as far as routing
but instead saw how a search engine could be distributed between threads in my
computer. It doesn't compile at the moment but i did try to get it working by 
making some assumptions.  I assumed a central routing server which knew which
ip addresses mapped to which words and would allow nodes to index urls at nodes 
and search for url count pairs at other nodes.
